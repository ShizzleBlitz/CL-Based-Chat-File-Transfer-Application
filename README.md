A command line based file transfer and chatting application made in C++ for Linux.


# Setup
This application was creted in Linux and requires a c++ compiler to execute. To setup the server, you must first specify the address of the server in the Client.cpp file. It is the variable labeled "CommunityIP".

Afterwards, both files must be compiled and the Community file should be run first. Then you can add as many clients as you want to the server and have them exchange files with each other.
